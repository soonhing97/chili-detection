By referring to the image shown in Figure 8, the chili clustering, the following table shows how to calculate its ripeness.

Cluster	%Area(pixels)	  RGB	          Lab	      Category
1	      28.3	          18 11 6	      3 2 3	    Green
2	      19.8	          71 59 50	    26 5 8	  Ignored
3	      19.07	          57 17 16	    12 20 11	Red
4	      17.6	          158 145 146	  61 5 1	Ignored
5	      15.15	          157 68 79	    41 39 13	Red


Using the equation (1), 
Ripeness of chili=  (Area of red color in pixel)/(Total pixel of chili)  x 100%
                                   =   (19.07+15.15)/(28.3+19.07+15.15)  x 100%
                                   =   54.64%
